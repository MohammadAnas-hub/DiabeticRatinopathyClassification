# DiabeticRatinopathyClassification
This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based project aimed at classifying Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) into five distinct stages, from no DR to severe DR. This project utilizes a cnn to automate the process of detecting and classifying the severity of Diabetic Retinopathy, facilitating early diagnosis and treatment options for affected individuals.

## Result
In the course of this project, our CNN-based model demonstrated a testing accuracy of 61% in classifying Diabetic Retinopathy across its five stages. While there's room for improvement, this result underscores the model's potential as a foundational tool for early DR detection and classification, offering a significant step towards leveraging AI in the fight against this sight-threatening condition.
